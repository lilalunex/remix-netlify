    <h2>Socialize MMO</h2>
    <p>
      In thinking about what little chill game you can play here and there,
      <br></br>
      I came up with this idea.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      2D MMO. Playable in the browser. Just hop in. Text with random people.
      <br></br>
      Maybe features like fishing, housing.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      I'd like to work on that one day.<br></br>
      Mostly for fun and vision.
